Our team studies the contribution of <b>transposable elements</b> (TEs) as a source of heritable allelic and epiallelic variation with a particular focus on its molecular mechanisms in <b>autopolyploids</b>. To tackle these questions, we use the reference plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> as a model and combines multi-omic bioinformatic approaches with plant molecular genetics and field collections.

### Genetic and environmental determinants of transposition in nature

Standing genetic variation is generally thought to be the main source of rapid adaptation to environmental changes. As a result, genomic studies aimed at estimating the evolutionary potential of native populations in future climates have mostly focused on SNPs. However, there is increasing evidence that the rare and typically large effect alleles created by TE insertions, even though mostly deleterious, can be sometimes beneficial and contribute significantly to local adaption. Leveraging the multi-omic and bio-climatic data for more than 1,000 wild <em>A. thaliana</em> accessions sequenced as part of the 1001 Genomes project, we set out to determine the rate of TE mobilization and its potential to create adaptive variation in natural settings.

Using an updated pipeline to detect TE insertion polymorphisms (TIPs) from short-read sequencing data (see SPLITREADER package [here](code.md)), we identified >23,000 TIPs across >1000 accessions from across the globe. Based on this dataset, we determined the substitution rate of TIPs in nature to be almost a third of that of SNPs (between 0.06-0.08 TE insertion per genome per generation) and very close to the actual transposition rate we measured experimentally. However, unlike SNPs, TE insertions tend to have large deleterious effects when they insert within or near genes (which occurs at least 50% of the time for some TE families) and are therefore rapidly purged by purifying selection. Nonetheless, we found some gene loci to be recurrently targeted by TE insertions (most notably <em>FLC</em>â€™s 1st intron), and these tended to be found in disturbed environments where they showed signatures of positive selection.

Furthermore, we also found that a naturally truncated variant of <em>NRPE1</em> (a key component of the RdDM pathway which targets DNA methylation over TEs) causes lower CHH methylation and higher levels of transposition, largely by enhancing the environmental sensitivity (GxE) of TEs. Strikingly, this mutator <em>NRPE1</em> allele is enriched at the edge of the environmental niche of <em>A. thaliana</em> where it itself shows signature of positive selection, akin in a way to bacterial mutator alleles that can be temporarily beneficial in harsh environments. How such an allele has been retained over long term in <em>A. thaliana</em> opens exciting avenues of inquiry, especially in times of climate crisis where TEs may be essential genomic players in the demise or rescue of native populations.

### TEs, polyploidy, and allelic exploration: 

Whole genome duplications (WGDs) are recurrent events throughout eukaryote evolution and the initial adaptive advantage they are associated with has been attributed in part to the increased genetic diversity of polyploid genomes (Baduel et al., _Front Ecol Evol_ 2018). Yet, the molecular mechanisms generating this diversity remain unclear. 

In this axis, we aim at investigating the role of transposable element (TE) mobilization in the rapid generation of genetic variation following WGD. Indeed, TEs are powerful generators of major-effect mutations with specific sensitivities to environmental stress, which confer them a unique potential to contribute to rapid local adaptations. Furthermore, the epigenetic mechanisms that control their mobilization, notably DNA methylation, is disrupted by WGD in several species. Thus, TEs could represent a major engine of phenotypic exploration for neo-polyploids, notably in the face of challenging environments.
