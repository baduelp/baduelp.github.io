Weediness in ephemeral plants is commonly characterized by rapid cycling, prolific all-in flowering, and loss of perenniality.
Many species made transitions to weediness of this sort, which can be advantageous in high-disturbance or human-associated
habitats. The molecular basis of this shift, however, remains mostly mysterious. Here, we use transcriptome sequencing, genome
resequencing scans for selection, and stress tolerance assays to study a weedy population of the otherwise nonweedy _Arabidopsis
arenosa_, an obligately outbreeding relative of _Arabidopsis thaliana_. Although weedy _A. arenosa_ is widespread, a single genetic
lineage colonized railways throughout central and northern Europe. We show that railway plants, in contrast to plants from
sheltered outcrops in hill/mountain regions, are rapid cycling, have lost the vernalization requirement, show prolific flowering,
and do not return to vegetative growth. Comparing transcriptomes of railway and mountain plants across time courses with and
without vernalization, we found that railway plants have sharply abrogated vernalization responsiveness and high constitutive
expression of heat- and cold-responsive genes. Railway plants also have strong constitutive heat shock and freezing tolerance
compared with mountain plants, where tolerance must be induced. We found 20 genes with good evidence of selection in the
railway population. One of these, _LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL_, is known in _A. thaliana_ to regulate many stress-response
genes that we found to be differentially regulated among the distinct habitats. Our data suggest that, beyond life history
regulation, other traits like basal stress tolerance also are associated with the evolution of weediness in _A. arenosa_.
